# Facial Recognition using Python
<br>
<h2>In this module, I have used the following libraries:</h2>
<ol>
  <li>OpenCV: This library is used to load and show images and use web camera.</li>
  <li>Face_Recognition: This library is used to encode faces from a loaded image from a database and identify those faces either in a different image or from a web-cam live feed.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How to use this model?</h2>
<p>Follow these steps to use this model: </p>
<ol>
  <li>Clone this repository.</li>
  <li>Navigate to the cloned folder and place your images that you want the model to train on in the "images" folder.</li>
  <li>Run "RecognitionFromLiveFeed.py" either on your terminal or on an IDE. It will open your web-cam and if the face in-front of the camera is found in the images folder (the files that you trained on), the model will recognize that face and tell us the name of the person (title of the image).</li>

<em>Note: This project uses Python 3.8. The lastest version of Python does not support face_recognition library yet. You can download Python 3.8.7 from this <a href = "https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-387/">link</a></em>
